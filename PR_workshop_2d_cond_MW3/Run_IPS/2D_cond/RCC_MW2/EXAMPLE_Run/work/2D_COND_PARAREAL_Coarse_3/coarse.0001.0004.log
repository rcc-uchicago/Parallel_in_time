FEM2D_HEAT
  FORTRAN90 version:
 
  Solution of the time dependent heat equation
  on a unit box in 2 dimensions.
 
  Ut - Uxx - Uyy = F(x,y,t) in the box
        U(x,y,t) = G(x,y,t) for (x,y) on the boundary.
        U(x,y,t) = H(x,y,t) for t = T_INIT.
 
  The finite element method is used, with piecewise
  quadratic basis functions on 6 node triangular
  elements.
 
  The backward Euler formula is used for 
  the time derivative.
 
  The corner nodes of the triangles are generated by an
  underlying grid whose dimensions are
 
  NX =                              100
  NY =                              100
 
  Number of nodes =               39601
  Number of elements =            19602
  The matrix half bandwidth is      398
  The matrix row size is           1195
 
FEM2D_HEAT:
  Wrote an ASCII node file
    "nodes.txt"
  of the form
    X(I), Y(I)
  which can be used for plotting.
 
FEM2D_HEAT:
  Wrote an ASCII element file
    "elements.txt"
  of the form
    Node(1) Node(2) Node(3) Node(4) Node(5) Node(6)
  which can be used for plotting.
